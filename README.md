- 👋 Hi, my name is Brandon, however, online I call myself @BeardR6S.

- 👀 I’m interested in mostly... Depends on what we are talking about, for example if we are talking about when I have free time I love traveling as I was stationed in Germany from 2013-2015 and traveled as much as I could while there. I also really enjoy playing video games mostly FPS style games for example Rainbow Six Siege has been my favorite game since 2016 as it helped me cope with the loss of my mother, it played such and integral role during that time that it is actually apart of my social media presence hence the R6S in my name. I also enjoy cooking and reading. // Now if we are talking about computer types of things I enjoy troubleshooting peoples problems and trying to help them fix it to the best of my ability as well as learning new things I don't know or understand. I also enjoy learning how to code as well as solve problems that arise in anything I do.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning... Full Stack Web Development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... nothing at the moment, as I am still working on learning the stuff needed to be useful to a team or organization.

- 📫 How to reach me is TBD, Working on that currently however my twitter "@" is the same as it is here, I will say though my twitter is mostly for gaming related things so I do use profanity and things when on this twitter so be aware however if you want to reach out to me that would be the best way as of right now.
